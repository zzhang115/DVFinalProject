    <iframe align="middle" src="./Visualizations/final_vis1_barchart.html" width="100%" height="700"></iframe>
    <h5 style="text-align:left;">Most countries have a relative peace environment to develop its economy and increase the population, hence the food consumed by those countries do not fluctuate too much. We choose Ukraine for the demonstration to prove the relationship between population, economy and food consumed was because Ukraine was devided from the Soviet Union in 1992 so its data has a very vivid and apparent differences across the years from 1992 to 2013.</h5>

    <h5 style="text-align:left;"> From two treemap(Feed treemap and Food treemap) we got, we can clearly see the amount comparison from the area of rectangle. The comparison can be affected by its religion and economic growth of a country. For example, China is the No.1 among two maps. India definitely has much more Food amount than Feed, since India called a vegetarian country with less meat consumption etc.</h5>

    <iframe src="./Visualizations/geomap.html" width="100%" height="700"></iframe>
    <h5 style="text-align:left;"> From the geomap of ratio of Food and Feed, generally, we cannot say that the developed country has higher ratio, since this indicator can be affected by people eating diet, religion, population, animal agriculture, economic growth etc.  Based on these factors, we should move forward and  conduct the next analysis.</h5>
